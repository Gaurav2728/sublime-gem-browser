* Sublime Gem Browser

For Ruby projects using the Bundler gem.

This plugin allows you to quickly access the code of a gem that you have installed via Bundler in the current project. When you select a gem, a new Sublime Text 2 window will open with the code ready for inspection.

** Known issues / limitations
- It should not work on Windows (it has only been tested in OS X and Linux)
- It requires an open file in your current project
- The way to open the gem folder is limited to standard OS X Sublime Text 2 installation paths (we'll need to improve this)
- Only tested on Rails 3+ and Bundler 1.0+
